      "Here are the next steps we'll take to resolve this issue:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Within 1 business day: I will thoroughly review your account history to determine when and how the plan change occurred.\n",
      "2. By the end of the next business day: I will contact you with the findings of our investigation.\n",
      "3. If an error is confirmed: We will immediately downgrade your account back to the $29.99 plan and process a refund for the difference ($20) within 3-5 business days.\n",
      "4. If the upgrade was intentional: We will provide you with information about the premium plan features and offer you the choice to either keep the upgrade or revert to your previous plan.\n",
      "\n",
